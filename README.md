# Hello there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Nick Veale ðŸ¤Ÿ

I am a full stack web developer based in the beautiful *Wellington New Zealand* ðŸ‡³ðŸ‡¿ I have skills in __React, Node.js, AWS, Python, MongoDB,__ and __MySQL__ to name a few, but the list is much longer and forever growing! 

Since writing my first lines of code last year, I have fallen in love with programming and can't wait to see where each new project will lead me.

I love creating simple solutions to solve complex problems, and crafting beautful user interfaces with fun and addictive animations.

#### Technologies Used: `['Next.js', 'React.js', 'React-Spring', 'SVG', 'REST API]`

In order to learn the ins and outs of SVG, I decided to build a Pokedex by handcoding individual XML SVG elements. I got a bit carried away and made it consume the PokeAPI, so now it's a fully functional Pokedex. This was a fun afternoon's work!

Award winning Stuff.co.nz photographer _Rosa Woods_ needs a place to put all of her photos, and a way for people to contact her for work! I'm refining a sleek design using Next.js that puts her beautiful images at the heart of the website.
