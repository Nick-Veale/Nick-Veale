# Hello there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Nick Veale ðŸ¤Ÿ

I am a full stack web developer based in the beautiful *Wellington New Zealand* ðŸ‡³ðŸ‡¿ I have skills in __React, Node.js, AWS, Python, MongoDB,__ and __MySQL__ to name a few, but the list is much longer and forever growing! 

Since writing my first lines of code last year, I have fallen in love with Programming and can't wait to see where each new project will lead me.

I love creating simple solutions to solve complex problems, and crafting beautful user interfaces with fun and addictive animations.
